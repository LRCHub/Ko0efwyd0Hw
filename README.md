```
Where my drums at?
逆さまに見る places (ay)
上下左右に揺れてる (ay)
今捉える eyes 変わり続ける the world (ay)
音の鳴る方へ ready to go
俺らの武器はそう 流れるような flow
手にするのは drums 打ち鳴らす鼓動 yeah
今欲しい俺だけの my new gear
アガる beat ノレる kick 魅せる high speed
目覚めていく odd-eye (odd-eye yeah)
見違えるように no more frame
この両目で映し出せ new rule
Yeah
Where my drums at?
(Ay, nah, where they at, where they at?)
Where my drums at?
(近づく where they at)
Where my drums at?
音の方へ
Where my drums at?
見つけ出せ where they at
共鳴するこのセッション (ay)
今始まるんだ show (ay) (始まるんだ show)
一瞬を刻み込めよ turn off mute
想像した世界 今 make it true
スピード上げて wake up "つもり"なら back off
皆その胸迫る兆し連れ jump yeah
傷つけるためじゃない武器 take it
轟かす 俺らの音を playing
目覚めていく odd-eye (odd-eye yeah)
見違えるように no more frame
この両目で映し出せ new rule
Yeah
Where my drums at?
(Ay, nah, where they at, where they at?)
Where my drums at?
(近づく where they at)
Where my drums at?
音の方へ
Where my drums at?
Yeah, get it, get it, get it, make it, make it loud
Tell me, tell me where they at
Tell me where they at
Let me hit the beat
Na, na na na, na na (what?)
Na, na na na, na na (ya)
Na, na na na, na na (where they at where they at yeah)
Na, na na na
Bang the drums we go on and on and on and on
Where my drums at?
(Where they at, where they at?)
Where my drums at?
(近づく where they at)
Where my drums at?
音の方へ
Where my drums at? (見つけ出せ where they at)
(Where my drums at?)
Where they at? Where they at yeah (nah)
Where they at? Where they at yeah
(Where my drums at?)
Where they at? Where they at yeah
近づく where they at
Where my drums at?
